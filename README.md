This was a data-to-text project that I completed under the guidance of my supervisor Somayajulu Sripada. The project used the seq2seq + attention model to transform the structured data of NBA games into summaries and trained another neural network to evaluate the quality of the generated text. I used the state-of-art model on the dataset and a new model I designed to conduct comparative experiments on the original dataset and an improved dataset respectively. Each experiment was repeated ten times with different seeds. In addition to the basic Bleu score metric, I also used three other metrics which are more important to data-to-text tasks, Relation Generation, Relation Selection, Relation Ordering. Finally, I analyzed the performance of different models and datasets in detail by combining experiment data and statistical test methods. The total GPU time of the experiment was Â 1920 hours (80days). I used the High-Performance Computing of the University of Aberdeen to complete the experiment in about 15 days. I also developed a lot of automatic scripts to further improve the experiment efficiency. The experiment results from my research were used in a WIP paper(author: Craig Thomson, Zhijie Zhao, Somayajulu Sripada) to be published in INLG 2020.
